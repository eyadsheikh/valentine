Valentine page

Open `index.html` in a browser to show a simple "Will you be my Valentine?" page with two buttons: Yes and No. The No button moves away when hovered or attempted to click, making Yes the only practical choice.

Try opening with PowerShell:

```powershell
# from the folder containing these files
Start-Process index.html
```

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — styles
- `script.js` — JS that moves the No button away and handles the Yes click

Feel free to ask for style tweaks, confetti, or a printable card version.
